        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ul>
                <li>3 large baking apples (such as Honeycrisp)</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 stick unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons light brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons dark rum</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons white sugar for the top</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting (optional)</li>

            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9-inch round cake pan with butter and line the bottom with parchment paper. </li>
                <li>Peel (or leave skin on) and core apples; cut into cubes between 1/4 and 3/8-inch in size. A little smaller is okay, but if your cubes are any larger, they won't get tender enough when baked.  Add to a large bowl and toss with apple cider vinegar.</li>
                <li>Mix together flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer until light and fluffy. Beat in 1 egg on high speed until it is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Add the second egg and repeat. Mix in rum, vanilla extract, and 1/2 of the flour mixture.  When the flour disappears add the rest, and fold in with a spatula. </li>
                <li>Fold in apples until evenly mixed into the batter. Transfer batter to the prepared pan, making sure all the batter is pressed in firmly. Smooth top and dust with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, about 45 minutes. </li>
                <li>Remove cake from oven and let cool in the pan for about 30 minutes. Invert cooled cake onto a wire rack, place a serving plate on top, and flip back over. Dust top with powdered sugar and serve.</li>
